## My process

### Built with

- HTML

### What I learned

Using Flexbox on the body to center the whole div-container is done like this:

```html
<body>
    <div class="profile-container">
        <!-- content of the container in here -->
    </div>
</body>
```
```css
body {
    display: flex;
    justify-content: center;
    align-items: center;
}
```
